# Data-Science-Internship-Protuner-Technologies

This repo contains the files I worked on during my Data Science internship at Protuner technologies. The internship was undertaken in April-May 2024.
They provided me a large dataset of restaurants and my main role for me was to build a model to predict the ratings of restaurants and gather meaningful insights from the data.
My regression model achieved an accuracy of 98% and further details are listed below.

## Task 1

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Steps:**

- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the testing data.
- Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
