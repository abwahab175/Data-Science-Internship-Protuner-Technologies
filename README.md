# Data-Science-Internship-Protuner-Technologies

This repo contains the files I worked on during my Data Science internship at Protuner technologies. The internship was undertaken in April-May 2024.
They provided me a large dataset of restaurants and my main role for me was to build a model to predict the ratings of restaurants and gather meaningful insights from the data.
My regression model achieved an accuracy of 98% and further details are listed below.

## Task 1

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Steps:**

* Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
* Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the testing data.
* Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

## Task 2

**Objective:** Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

**Steps:**

* Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
* Determine the criteria for restaurant recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference, price range).
* Implement a content-based filtering approach where users are recommended restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
* Test the recommendation system by providing sample user preferences and evaluating the quality of recommendations.

## Task 3

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

**Steps:**

* Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and train it on the training data.
* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on the testing data.
* Analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.
